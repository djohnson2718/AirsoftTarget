# Code for Arduino Airsoft target game

I've had this project in the back of my mind for years. This summer I finally started it.

The game involves a board with metal targets hanging from it. Lights light up and show you which target to hit (with an airsoft gun). Piezo-electric sensors register the hit and turn the lights off. You get 1 bad point for every .2 seconds that a light is on. 

Here's a picture of the back of the board with the wiring.

Here's a video, showing the front and what it looks like in action. (Normally I would be shooting it with the gun, not tapping with plier handles, but it is too cold outside right now!)

## Status
The code works. There are some problems with the sensitivity of the sensors that I need to work on. Once that is fixed, I may add some new variations on the games. 

## Notes
1/4 inch particle board is not strong enough for an electric airsoft gun! Acrylic shatters easily, but polycarbonate is much stronger! 

I will add some more detailed notes about the construction and things I learned in the future.
